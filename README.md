# Hair_Day_Website_Home_Page

this project showcases my capabilities creating HTML/CSS homepages (March 2024)
The Hair Day project was a submission for Meta's HTML and CSS in depth course through coursera.
The project's aim was to create a homepage that showcases transitions, animations, and CSS styling concepts, while keeping a focus on adequate UI/UX. This is my first project of this type. The pictures used were found randomly online and are only meant to be used to promote my learning.
